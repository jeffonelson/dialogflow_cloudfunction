# DialogFlow Agent and Cloud Function eVect Example

*Demonstrates a Dialogflow Agent running on GCP Cloud Functions with BiqQuery integration.*

## DialogFlow Agent

Agents are best described as Natural Language Understanding (NLU) modules.
This **eVect** agent is trained to ingest text and spoken user requests and provide disease, health, and medical information.
This translation occurs when a user's utterance matches an intent within the **eVect** agent.

The DialogFlow agent is responsible for handling *Intents*, *Entities*, and *Fulfillment* of user requests.

### Import eVect Agent

The **eVect** agent can be found in its entirety under `eVect_agent/eVect.zip`.
This zip file contains all of the JSON files related to the agent (Intents, Training Phases, Contexts, etc.)
Simply import this zip file in the DialogFlow web console to create the **eVect** agent.

## DialogFlow Intents

The eVect DialogFlow Agent currently has two features: **Warning and Prevention** and **Condition Intake** which are comprised of several Intents.

### Warning and Prevention

Warning and Prevention is comprised of one Intent, and a follow-up Intent.
This flow is for users that want health and disease information about a country they will be visiting.

An example conversation:

```
[user]: I am traveling to Indonesia next week.

[agent]:
Im looking into your trip
Here is a list of active diseases and contagions in Indonesia.

- Measles
- Hepatitis A
- Typhoid

If you would like prevention tips on a disease, respond with the name of the disease.

[user]: Tell me more about typhoid.

[agent]:
Let me look up some prevention tips for that.You can get typhoid through contaminated food or water in Indonesia.
CDC recommends this vaccine for most travelers, especially if you are staying with friends or relatives, visiting smaller cities or rural areas, or if you are an adventurous eater.

```


#### Training

The initial **Warning and Prevention** intent is triggered by the user describing a future trip to a country. Sample test phrases include:

`I will be traveling to South America.`

`I'm visiting family in England.`

`I am backpacking across Africa.`

`I'm going to Indonesia.`

### Condition Intake
Condition Intake is comprised of one Intent, and 3 follow-up Intents. This intent is triggered when user's
tell the agent they are not feeling well on their trip.

An example conversation:

```
[agent]: Good day! What can I do for you today?

[user]: I'm experiencing a high fever on my trip

[agent]: What city are you currently located in?

[user]: Paris.

[agent]: I understand that you are currently experiencing High Fever on your trip to Paris. Is this correct?

[user] : Yes.

[agent]: 
I would like to gather some more information on your current condition. 
Could you please tell me if you're experiencing any of the following symptoms?
- Severe Headache
- Joint Pain
- Eye Pain

[user]: I'm also experiencing a severe headache and eye pain.

[agent]:
Thank you for your cooperation. 
Based on recent outbreaks in your area and the symptoms you're exhibiting, you may have Dengue Fever. 
Please make your way to

1 Parvis Notre-Dame - Pl. Jean-Paul II, 75004 Paris, France 

for immediate treatment. Would you like additional hospital locations in your area?

[user]: Yes please give me more hospital options.

[agent]: 
There are other medical facilities located at:

47-83 Boulevard de l'HÃ´pital, 75013 Paris, France

and

1 Avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75010 Paris, France
```

#### Training

The initial **Condition Intake** intent is triggered by the user describing symptoms of their condition or mentioning that they feel unwell.
Sample test phrases include:

`I'm experiencing muscle pain in London.`

`I have back pain and a fever.`

`Everything hurts.`

`I feel sick in Hong Kong.`

## DialogFlow Entities

Entities are Dialogflow's mechanism for identifying and extracting useful data from natural language inputs.
DialogFlow comes pre-built with several system Entities such as `geo-country` or `geo-city` that can be utilized out of the box.
In addition to those pre-built Entities **eVect** relies on the following custom trained Entities:

`@Disease`

`@Symptom`

The `@Disease` Entity is used to capture when a user mentions a Disease such as `Polio`, `Malaria`, or `Typhoid`.

The `@Symptom` Entity is used to capture when a user mentions their symptoms such as `Joint Pain`, `Nausea`, or `Fever`.

Entities can be trained and created from the DialogFlow console.

## DialogFlow Fulfillment

Fulfillment is handled via web hook to a GCP Cloud Function. Each intent and follow-up intent has a corresponding
function within `functions/index.js`. The function handler must be mapped to the intent:

```javascript
  let intentMap = new Map();
  intentMap.set('Warning and Prevention', warningAndPreventionIntent);
  intentMap.set('Warning and Prevention - followup', warningAndPreventionFollowup);
  agent.handleRequest(intentMap);
```

#### DialogFlow Agent

DialogFlow sends in an `agent` object to every function handler. The agent is used to handle conversation and context state.
For example, when a user says `I will be traveling to Indonesia`, the agent captures the value of `Indonesia` as a `geo-country`:

```javascript
  function warningAndPreventionIntent(agent) {
    let userCountry = agent.parameters['geo-country'];
```

The agent is also used to respond to user inputs and queries. Use the `agent.add()` function to respond to the user:

```javascript
    const gotCountry = userCountry.length > 0;

    if(gotCountry) {
      agent.add('Im looking into your trip');
    }
```

#### Cloud Function BigQuery Integration
Once DialogFlow has the proper input arguments from the user, Cloud Functions will query Big Query:

```javascript
      const OPTIONS = {
              query: 'SELECT disease.name FROM `la-hackathon-agent.slalom_hackathon.cdc_disease`, unnest(disease) disease WHERE country = @country',
              timeoutMs: 10000,
              useLegacySql: false,
              params: {country: userCountry[0]}
      };

      return bigquery
      .query(OPTIONS)
      .then(results => {
          const ROWS = results[0];
          let diseaseList = [];

          if(ROWS.length > 1) {
            agent.add(`Here is a list of active diseases and contagions in ${userCountry}. \n - ${diseaseList.join('\n - ')} \nIf you would like prevention tips on a disease, respond with the name of the disease.`);
```

Using `agent.add()` DialogFlow can respond to the user request dynamically with the BigQuery results.

##### Intent Context

In order for Dialogflow follow-up intents to understand the context of the conversation,
Dialogflow contexts can be used. Contexts essentially act as an event bus, being used to pass user input values
to follow-up contexts.

When the agent asks the user to select a disease to learn more about, the `country` parameter
is added to the context object to be used by a future intent:

```javascript
agent.context.set({
  name: 'prevention-followup',
  lifespan: 2,
  parameters: {
    country: userCountry
  }
});
```

The `country` context parameter is then utilized in a follow-up intent's Big Query call:

```javascript
  function warningAndPreventionFollowup(agent) {
    const preventionContext = agent.context.get('prevention-followup');
    const disease = agent.parameters['Disease'];
    const userCountry = preventionContext.parameters['country'];

    const OPTIONS = {
            query: 'SELECT disease.description FROM `la-hackathon-agent.slalom_hackathon.cdc_disease`, unnest(disease) disease where disease.name= @dis and country = @country',
            timeoutMs: 10000,
            useLegacySql: false,
            params: {dis: disease, country: userCountry[0]}
    };
```

##### Fulfillment Deployment

This DialogFlow webhook is hosted on **Cloud Functions for Firebase**.
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required to deploy the Fulfillment.

1. Setup Firebase CLI

   `npm install -g firebase-tools`

2. Authenticate

   `firebase login`

3. Initialize Firebase

    ```

Once the Cloud Function is deployed, head to the Dialogflow console navigation menu.
Click Fulfillment, toggle the Webhook button to ENABLED , and replace the url in the URL field with your Function URL.

## eVect BigQuery Database

Data used to power eVect stems from a variety of different public sources. The data allow the Dialogflow agent smartly process several related questions by an end user, all stemming from very different sources. Data were accessed via public APIs or public FTP sites and then lightly processed into *newline delimited JSON (NDJSON)* using [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) Data were then loaded to BigQuery using the [BigQuery Python Client](https://googleapis.github.io/google-cloud-python/latest/bigquery/index.html). 

This repo contains the load NDJSON formatted data and Python load scripts in the `bigquery` directory. Included below is a short description and access location of the principal data sources:
